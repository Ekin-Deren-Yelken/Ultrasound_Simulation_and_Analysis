# Ultrasound_Simulation_and_Analysis
Three projects in teh simulation and analysis of python

Ultrasound Simulation and Analysis
Projects:

1. Write a simulation of ultrasound wave propagation using finite element analysis (FEA).
2. Implement an algorithm to calculate Doppler shift for blood flow measurements.
3. Develop a software tool to visualize ultrasound transducer array patterns.
Ideal Language: Python (for simulation and visualization), MATLAB (for signal modeling), C++ (for performance optimization)
