# Doppler Shift Calculation for Blood Flow Measurements

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an algorithm to calculate the Doppler shift in ultrasound signals based on interactions with moving blood particles, enabling blood flow velocity estimation.

### Objectives
- Simulate ultrasound wave interactions with moving particles.
- Implement signal processing techniques to extract Doppler frequency shifts.
- Visualize and analyze the results using Python or MATLAB.

## Background

### Doppler Effect in Ultrasound Imaging
The Doppler effect describes the frequency shift that occurs when ultrasound waves reflect off moving blood cells. The relationship between the transmitted frequency, received frequency, and velocity of moving particles is given by the following equation:

$f_d = \frac{2 f_t v \cos(\theta)}{c}$

Where:  
- $f_d$ = Doppler shift (Hz)  
- $f_t$ = Transmitted frequency (Hz)  
- $v$ = Blood flow velocity (m/s)  
- $&theta;$ = Angle between ultrasound beam and blood flow direction (degrees)  
- $c$ = Speed of sound in biological tissue (~1540 m/s)  

### Types of Doppler Ultrasound
- **Continuous Wave (CW) Doppler:** Constant wave transmission and reception for high-velocity detection.
- **Pulsed Wave (PW) Doppler:** Short bursts of ultrasound to measure velocity at specific depths.
